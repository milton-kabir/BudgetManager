# Budget Manager

Not to sound overly serious, but it’s very important to manage your budget. This implies analyzing your expenses and estimating the income, which sometimes may be difficult to do yourself. Luckily, technology is there to assist: you can create your own personal budget manager program that counts the ins and outs and helps control the finances.

To better control the expenses, we need to categorize our purchases. It helps to see how exactly your budget is distributed: you may be actually quite surprised! 

The program have the following categories:
Food
Clothes
Entertainment
Other

We can save purchases to file. Add items Save and Load to the menu.

There are three of them:

    Sort All – sort the entire shopping list and display it so that the most expensive purchases are at the top of the list.
    Sort By Type – show which category eats the most money. If a category has no purchases in it the total sum should be $0.
    Sort Certain Type – same as Sort All, but for a specific category
